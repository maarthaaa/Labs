Requirements
XQuarz preinstalled

The DISPLAY environment variable will instruct the X client which X server to connect to. 
The X display server install itself normally as the display number 0 on your local machine. 
However, the ‘local machine’ refers to the machine on which we run the application, in our case the docker container. 
We need to re-route this display to our ‘true’ local machine.

The server knows where to redirect the X network traffic via the DISPLAY environment variable. 
To set this up, we need to follow these steps:

Get Host IP
IP=$(ifconfig en0 | grep inet | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}')

Set the DISPLAY environment variable:
export DISPLAY=$IP:0

Add Path to our xhost:
export PATH=/usr/X11/bin/xhost:$PATH

Add IP to xhost
xhost + $IP

Run container
docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --name tkinter-app tkinter-docker
